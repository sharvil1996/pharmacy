				<h2 style="margin-bottom: 10px;" class="fgmain">Tablet Section</h2>
				<h3 class="fgmain">Overview</h3>
				<p class="paragraph" style="margin-top: 5px;">The manufacture of
					oral solid dosage forms such as tablets is a complex multi-stage
					process under which the starting materials change their physical
					characteristics a number of times before the final dosage form is
					produced. In the tablet-pressing process, all ingredients taken are
					dry, powdered and of uniform grain size as much as possible. It is
					ensured that the appropriate amount of active ingredient is equal
					in each tablet so ingredients are well-mixed.
				<p>
				<h4 class="fgmain">Quality</h4>
				<p class="paragraph" style="margin-top: 5px;">The quality of all
					the raw materials are ascertained and standardized referring.
					Homoeopathic pharmacopeia India. Pharmacopoeia grade, high class
					SAPUTO lactose imported from Canada is used for all our tablet
					preparations which is stored in a dehumidified area.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Tablets are constantly subjected to. Such
					stress in the tablets can lead to issues such as capping,
					aberration, or even breakage. So, it is therefore important that
					the tablet is formulated to also withstand such stresses. As a part
					of Quality Control, below are the tests those are performed for
					each batch during manufacturing:</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					<span class="bold">Friability Test:</span> Friability is defined as
					the % of weight loss by tablets due to mechanical action during the
					test. Dr. Raj's tablets undergo friability test to monitor the
					resistance of tablets to mechanical shocks & aberration during the
					manufacturing, packing and transportation processes.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					<span class="bold">Hardness testing:</span> The tablets undergo
					hardness testing which is nothing but crushing strength of a
					tablet. This is important for checking the tablets resistance to
					capping, aberration, or even breakage.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					<span class="bold">Dissolution time test:</span> Active absorption
					of oral dosage forms depends on adequate release of the API from
					the product. Dissolution or solubility of the API play pivotal role
					in this aspect. Dissolution testing is used as a tool to identify a
					crucial effect in the bioavailability of the API.
				</p>
				<h4 class="fgmain">Process Control</h4>
				<p class="paragraph" style="margin-top: 5px;">Weight variation
					test: at every 30 minutes the readings are taken of a tablet which
					calculate the weight, disintegration-time, friability %, and
					hardness.</p>
				<h4 class="fgmain">Tablet Manufacturing Process & Machineries</h4>
				<p class="paragraph" style="margin-top: 5px;">
					1. Formulation<br> 2. Mixing<br> 3. Wet Granulation<br>
					4. Dry Granulation<br> 5. Uniform Blending & Lubrication<br>
					6. Compression<br>
				</p>
				<h4 class="fgmain">Formulation</h4>
				<p class="paragraph" style="margin-top: 5px;">A formula contains
					ingredients other than the active ingredients called Excipients.
					Excipients enhance the hardness, disintegration, appearance, color,
					taste, and the overall performance of the tablets. We perform an
					operation called wet binding where we also use ingredients in
					liquid form as per the formula in the binding operation, followed
					by homogenous mixing.</p>
				<h4 class="fgmain">Mixing</h4>
				<p class="paragraph" style="margin-top: 5px;">At Dr. Raj, we
					achieve a perfect homogeneity and needed cohesion to move between
					the individual particles of the mixture with a Mass Mixture. Mass
					Mixture is involved at the process steps of pre-granulation and
					post-granulation. The variability in the mixing process is
					controlled by mixing at an optimum time and mixing speed. This
					results in the consistent and high quality tablets.</p>
				<div class="tcenter">
					<img class="imgResponsive" src="imgs/aboutus_mp_1.png"
						style="max-height: 250px;" />
				</div>
				<h4 class="fgmain" style="margin-top: 10px;">Wet Granulation
					Process</h4>
				<p class="paragraph" style="margin-top: 5px;">The homogenous
					mixture is removed from the mass mixture and transferred to another
					equipment for granulation. The mixture passes through a specific
					size mesh in a granulator. At every step, specified consistent size
					throughout the granulation process is maintained. At. Dr. Raj, each
					granule contains a proper mix of the ingredients as in the formula.
					We are also equipped to process consistent granule density. This is
					achieved by setting and controlling the amount of liquid added in
					the mixture each time and mechanical speed of the Granulators.</p>
				<div class="tcenter">
					<img class="imgResponsive" src="imgs/aboutus_mp_2.png"
						style="max-height: 250px;" />
				</div>
				<h4 class="fgmain" style="margin-top: 10px;">Dry Granulation
					Process</h4>
				<p class="paragraph" style="margin-top: 5px;">The Wet granules
					from the above process are dried for specified, digitally
					controlled temperature and time in a Dryer. Dr. Raj is a GMP
					certified company, we use 304-316 graded steel quality vessels in
					all of our manufacturing processes. Thereby, the dried granules are
					taken for Dry Granulation process to compact powders further
					through specified mesh forming dry granules. This is done in a
					Granulator specified earlier. We maintain the quality of granules
					by controlling the size of granules.</p>
				<div class="tcenter">
					<img class="imgResponsive" src="imgs/aboutus_mp_3.png"
						style="max-height: 250px;" />
				</div>
				<h4 class="fgmain">Uniform Blending & Lubrication Process</h4>
				<p class="paragraph" style="margin-top: 5px;">The granules are
					now taken for homogenous blending and lubrication process in a Mass
					Mixture. Lubrication Process includes two steps: First, the
					specified lubricant as per the formula is added into the mixture to
					help proper flow of powder in the Compression Machine. Second,
					addition of active ingredients as per the formula and under the
					supervision of a chemist. If the active ingredients are in solid
					form and need extra steps of operation, then they are added at an
					earlier step in the overall process. The mixture is then
					homogenously mixed for specified time period. Dr. Raj recognizes a
					good final blend where powder can achieve and maintain good content
					uniformity and potency and not just by its ability to flow.</p>
				<h4 class="fgmain" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Tablet
					Compression</h4>
				<div class="tcenter">
					<iframe width="560" height="315"

						allowfullscreen style="max-width: 100%;"></iframe>
				</div>
				<p class="paragraph" style="margin-top: 5px;">After the
					preparation of dry granules they are compressed to get final
					product. Tablet compression process needs expertise and technical
					knowhow to operate the machine. The compression is done by
					Multi-Station Rotary Press Machine. Dr. Raj puts lot of effort on
					employee empowerment where proper training is provided to every
					employee following appropriate training plan. The final granulation
					to be compressed must have three basic characteristics, all of
					which are critical: Flow, Compress and Eject. Tablet hardness is a
					function of tablet thickness and tablet weight. We manufacture
					consist high quality tablets and have tight process controls.</p>
				<h4 class="fgmain">Packaging</h4>
				<p class="paragraph" style="margin-top: 5px;">Packaging Line
					Operation covers each component of the solid dosage, oral dosage
					and external preparation - tablet packaging, operation, cleaning,
					changeover, covering a wide variety of applications. Uniformity,
					cleanliness, sterility, and other requirements are needed to
					maintain Good Manufacturing Practices. We also have line
					integration, inspections and troubleshooting. We have a complete
					Quality Management System which involves collecting documentary
					evidence of all aspects of compliance like maintain SOP, critical
					control points are required in packaging methodology which has been
					proven useful. Our promise of quality assurance also extends beyond
					the packaging operations through distribution.</p>
				<h2 class="fgmain">Trituration Section</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">Triturations' are mostly 1x potency
					tablets. Dr. Raj competes with top brands in this area of
					expertise. We have expertise in the manufacturing processes and
					good knowhow on quality of the product. Dr. Raj follows the process
					to manufacture 1X single remedy medicines as written in
					Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia of India, HPI. The tablet manufacturing
					process is the same as described above. The only addition is the
					use of Kharal machine where we triturate the medicaments to bring
					them to the specified potency. The quality procedures are the same
					as described in the tablet section.</p>

				<h2 class="fgmain" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Oral Liquids
					(Syrup/Drops) Section</h2>
				<h3 class="fgmain">Overview</h3>
				<p class="paragraph" style="margin-top: 5px;">
					<span class="bold">Syrup:</span> A concentrated aqueous
					preparations of highest pharmaceutical grade sugar or sugar
					substitute with flavouring agents and medicinal substances is
					manufactured under different medicinal combination. In medicinal
					syrups, saturated solutions of sugar is mixed with demineralised
					water in which medicinal substances or drugs are dissolved. The
					fluid extract known as Dilution and Mother Tincture of the
					respective medicines is mixed with the syrup.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					<span class="bold">Drops:</span> For drops, demineralised water
					with the fluid extracts as medicines are dissolved. The fluid
					extracts are called Dilutions and Mother Tinctures. If the drugs
					prepared require solid medicines, then first they are prepared in
					the tablet section to attain appropriate potency, thereby used in
					the manufacturing.
				</p>
				<h4 class="fgmain" style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Quality</h4>
				<div class="bold">Weigh Balance</div>
				<p class="paragraph" style="margin-top: 5px;">We have high
					precision laboratory balances for weighing from 0.001 gm to 500gm
					accurately. We also a heavy duty platform scale of capacity 200kg.
					The accuracy of all weighing balance is maintained by tests such as
					Calibration, and Reproducibility Test.</p>

					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="bold">Clean and purified water/TDS measurement</div>
				<p class="paragraph" style="margin-top: 5px;">The water is
					filtered and purified at the plant to destroy any micro-organisms
					and to remove particles from the water. Quality control technicians
					test the water TDS frequently to ensure that it is clean and pure
					before the syrup is made. The syrup is also thoroughly filtered
					before filling in bottles.</p>
				<div class="bold">Visual Inspection</div>
				<p class="paragraph" style="margin-top: 5px;">With visual
					inspection, the ingredients and the final products are carefully
					examined for purity and for appearance. Physical appearance of
					products for patient adherence and compliance is critical.</p>
				<div class="bold">pH Measurement</div>
				<p class="paragraph" style="margin-top: 5px;">The measurement
					and maintenance of pH is one of the important parts of quality
					control testing. Physical stability tests in syrups include:</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					A. Appearance (no crystallization and microbial growth)<br> B.
					Color must be completely soluble with other ingredients.<br>
					C. Odour and taste (palatable)<br> D. Solid material is
					completely miscible in liquid.<br>
				</p>
				<div class="bold">Process Control</div>
				<p class="paragraph" style="margin-top: 5px;">Dr. Raj
					manufactures consistent quality product at all times. To achieve
					appropriate process control, all process steps are carefully
					reduced to writing after being shown to be effective. These process
					are standard operating procedures (SOPs), where no extemporaneous
					changes are permitted to be made in these procedures; any change
					must go through the same approval steps as the original written
					SOP. All external records are kept to give assurance at the end of
					the production process that all steps have been performed as
					prescribed. Such in-process control is essential to assuring the
					quality of the product, since these assurances are even more
					significant than those from product release testing.</p>
				<h4 class="fgmain" style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Oral Liquid
					Manufacturing Process & Machineries</h4>
